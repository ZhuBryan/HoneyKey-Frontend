  "incident_id": 1,
  "severity": "Medium",
  "summary": "An unauthorized entity utilized a known honeypot credential ('honeypot') to perform reconnaissance and repeated API access attempts (60 events) against sensitive endpoints including '/v1/users', '/v1/projects', and '/admin'. All activity was successfully contained within the honeypot environment, but confirms active probing.",
  "evidence": [
    "Source IP 127.0.0.1 engaged in 60 events over approximately 30 minutes (02:41 to 03:12 UTC).",
    "All recorded events logged 'honeypot_key_used: true', confirming the attacker used compromised or leaked canary credentials.",
    "The attacker systematically probed endpoints using automated methods (User-Agent: python-requests/2.32.5), specifically targeting resource lists (GET /v1/users, GET /v1/projects) and attempting administrative access (GET /admin).",
    "The actor attempted data modification/creation via POST requests to /v1/projects."
  ],
  "recommended_actions": [
    "Investigate the origin of the Source IP 127.0.0.1 to determine if this traffic originates from an internal host or a misconfigured external proxy/logging environment.",
    "Analyze the exposure vector of the 'honeypot' key to understand how the actor obtained the credential.",
    "Review related logs for activity outside the honeypot environment using the same IP or credential pattern.",
    "Extract full session data for inclusion in internal threat intelligence feeds."
