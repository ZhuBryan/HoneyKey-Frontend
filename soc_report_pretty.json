  "incident_id": 1,
  "severity": "Medium",
  "summary": "Unauthorized reconnaissance activity was detected utilizing a known honeypot authentication key. An entity originating from 127.0.0.1 made three rapid API requests targeting sensitive endpoints (e.g., /v1/secrets, /v1/projects) using cURL. The immediate triggering of the honeypot mechanism successfully contained the intrusion attempt.",
  "evidence": [
    "Source IP 127.0.0.1 performed 3 requests in under 50 milliseconds.",
    "All requests utilized an authentication token identified as a 'honeypot' key.",
    "Endpoints targeted included /v1/projects and /v1/secrets, indicative of enumeration attempts.",
    "User Agent identified as curl/8.7.1."
  ],
  "recommended_actions": [
    "Review logging infrastructure to identify the host mapping to the 127.0.0.1 source IP, if proxied.",
    "Analyze logs to determine how the honeypot key was exposed or tested.",
    "Monitor the source IP for any subsequent activity or attempts to use other credentials.",
    "Conduct a threat hunt for similar reconnaissance patterns across production environments."
